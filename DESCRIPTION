Description: A graphical user interface that utilizes the EPA's high-throughput 
            toxicokinetics 'httk' R package to generate toxicokinetic ADME simulations, 
            steady state concentrations, and common toxicokinetic (TK) parameters as well 
            as perform in vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) for user-selected 
            chemicals. Users select from the four main outputs described above, 
            and then choose all the input parameters and simulation preferences. 
            Once ready, they hit a 'run simulation' button and are able to download 
            any outputted plots, tables, or input data. The app also contains
            several features aimed at users interested in evaluating the 
            toxicokinetics of food-related chemicals.
