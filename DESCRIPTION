Description: A graphical user interface that utilizes the EPA's high-throughput 
            toxicokinetics 'httk' R package to generate toxicokinetic ADME 
            (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) simulations, steady 
            state concentrations, and common toxicokinetic (TK) parameters as well 
            as perform in vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) for user-selected 
            chemicals. Users select from the four main outputs described above, 
            and then select all the input parameters and preferences. Once ready, 
            they hit a 'run simulation' button and are able to download any 
            outputted plots, tables, or input data.
