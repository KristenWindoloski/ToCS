# ToCS

## Description

ToCS is an R package and web application in development that hosts a graphical user interface (GUI) for high-throughput simulation of chemical toxicokinetics (TK) and in vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE). The GUI is built upon the EPA's httk R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httk/index.html, https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v079i04), which utilizes general mathematical models to make high-throughput toxicokinetic predictions for chemicals with little available data. This GUI provides an easy to use computational toxicology tool to predict

- Concentration-time profiles
  - Generate ADME time course data, plot concentration curves over time, and obtain summary statistics such as Tmax, Cmax, and AUC for all model compartments
- Steady state concentrations
  - Create tables and plots of the analytical steady state concentration for desired concentrations and tissues as well as determine how long chemicals take to reach steady state behavior
- Oral equivalent doses (OEDs) from in vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE)
  - Construct tables and plots of OEDs (the external dose concentration needed to produce the internal bioactive concentration)
- Common TK parameter values
  - Calculate elimination rates, volumes of distribution, and partition coefficients

without the need to know R or any programming skills. While other GUIs have been created that use httk (Integrated Chemical Environment (ICE), https://ice.ntp.niehs.nih.gov/) and share similar features to ToCS, ours is unique in that it 

- Offers computation of analytical steady state concentrations and oral equivalent doses (OEDs) for each model compartment as well as volumes of distribution, elimination rates, partition coefficients, and other summary statistics for concentration-time profiles
- Calculates the number of days to reach steady state concentration
- Allows for further customization of simulations beyond basic model parameters
- Utilizes the most recent httk version (2.4.0)
- Allows for non-uniform chemical exposure (dosing), which can be beneficial for users interested in food chemicals
- Offers simulations for dog, rabbit, and mouse species in addition to human and rats
- Includes the option to load all in silico parameters within httk
- Offers the option to convert the nominal bioactive concentration to a free concentration in vitro for IVIVE simulations (recommended)
- Allows the user to declare the desired percentile of predicted OEDs and view all generated OED samples.

ToCS is a toxicokinetics application that can be used by scientists with little to no modeling or programming backgrounds, and requires a small amount of user input to generate basic simulations. If desired, simulations can be highly customizable through the Advanced Parameters option in ToCS.

## Getting Started 

- Users will need to have the free statistical computing language, R, installed (https://www.r-project.org/). 
- Although optional, users may also want to install RStudio (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) as a more user-friendly programming environment for R code.
- Download all the files from ToCS GitHub repository (https://github.com/KristenWindoloski/ToCS) on your local computer and save them in a folder called *ToCS*.
- The ToCS package uses 15 other packages (which are listed under the DESCRIPTION file in the GitHub repository), which will need to be installed on your local computer. To install package *X* listed under *Depends* or *Imports*, open R or RStudio and type the following into the R command line (console)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("X")
```
-  Then, change your working directory to the ToCS folder by typing the following into the R command line (console)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("filepath")
```
- Load all files in the directory into R by pressing Ctrl+Shift+L or typing the following into the R command line (console)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::load_all(.)
```
- To open the GUI, type the following into the R command line (console)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ToCS()
```
- A pop-up window should appear with the GUI interface shown below

<!-- To get started using R or RStudio, type the following into the R command line (console) -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- install.packages("ToCS") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- This will install the ToCS package. To load the package into your R session, type the following into the R command line (console) -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- library(ToCS) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- To then open the GUI, type the following into the R command line (console) -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- ToCS() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Then, follow the directions for *Using the Web Application* below. -->

<!-- #### Using the Web Application -->


<!-- You can install the development version of ToCS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("pak") -->
<!-- pak::pak("KristenWindoloski/ToCS") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Example

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(ToCS) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
